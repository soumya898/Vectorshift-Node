Why an empty pipeline is a valid DAG:


In graph theory, an empty graph (no nodes, no edges) is considered a valid Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) because:

No cycles exist - you can't have cycles with zero nodes
Vacuously true - all conditions for being a DAG are satisfied (there are no edges to violate the "acyclic" rule)

Standard definition - mathematically, an empty set satisfies all DAG properties
